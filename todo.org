* Dissasembler
  1. Review mnem for disas (rn it's meh)
  2. Decide on a damn interface for the instructions. 
	... do i want to deal with u8* or u16? u8* make me do less operations, 
	but i do like working with these u16...

* CPU
  1. Review Chip8 spec sheet just to make sure we got it all fine

* Instructions
  1. Review all the code for the instructions (as of right now they're all placeholders lol)
  2. implement the missing ones
  3. implement clock stufferino

* I/O (... if you can call it that)
  1. plug in the SDL stuff
  2. write a tile system for this tiny screen?
  3. audio stuff??

* Testing
  1. Write unit tests for every instruction
  2. Get incrementally more complex testing roms (fishie won't always cut it lol)

* Misc
** To separate or not to separate EMU/DISAS, _that_ is the question (it's actually not that important)
  why not just make the dissasembler be an option from the main executable?
  like ./chip8_emu.bin --disas or whatever?

  I mean... less voluminous emulator ig? It's not like that matters.
